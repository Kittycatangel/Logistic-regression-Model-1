# Logistic Regression

Unlike linear regression, logistic regression does not try to predict the value of a numeric variable given a set of inputs. Instead, the output of logistic regression is the probability of a given input point belonging to a specific class. The output of logistic regression always lies in [0,1].

Logistic regression is a classification model that is very easy to implement but performs very well on linearly separable classes. It is one of the most widely used algorithms for classification in industry. The logistic regression model in this chapter is also a linear model for binary classification that can be extended to multiclass classification.
